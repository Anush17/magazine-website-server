      "description": "<b>Facebook's owner Meta Platforms saw its stock market value slump by more than $230bn (£169bn) on Thursday, in a record daily loss for a US firm.</b>\n\nIts shares fell 26.4% after quarterly figures disappointed investors.\n\nMeta also said that Facebook's daily active users (DAUs) had dropped for the first time in its 18-year history.\n\nThe company's share price slide saw chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's net worth fall by $31bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe drop in Mr Zuckerberg's personal fortune was equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of Estonia.\n\nEven after that drop, Mr Zuckerberg has an estimated net worth of almost $90bn, which means he is still one of the richest people in the world.\n\nThat came after Meta revealed that Facebook's DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter.\n\nIt was the first time ever that this measure of activity on the world's biggest social network had gone into reverse.\n\nMeta's stock market slump came on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of Facebook.\n\nFacebook sees daily users fall for first time ever\nFacebook-funded cryptocurrency Diem winds down\nMeta also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rival platforms including TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers were also cutting spending.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals.\n\nThe firm forecast revenues of between $27bn and $29bn for the first quarter of this year, which was lower than analysts had expected.\n\nAlthough the company has been making investments in video services to compete with TikTok, owned by Chinese technology giant ByteDance, it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds."

Here is what we know about it. \n\n <b>What is BA.2?</b> \n\n As viruses mutate into new variants, they sometimes split or branch off into sub-lineages. The Delta variant, for example, comprises 200 different sub-variants.\n\nThe same happened with Omicron, which includes the lineages BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and B.1.1.529.\n\nBA.1 accounts for most of the cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 99% of viral DNA submitted to the global GISAID database as of 25 January were identified as this sub-variant. While BA.1 and BA.2 are similar, they are 20 mutations apart.\n\nIt is not clear where BA.2 originated, but it was first detected in the Philippines in November."

      "description": "But what happens when the wind is blowing, the turbines are cranking out electricity and there's no demand for it?\n\nIt's already a problem. In 2020, enough electricity to supply more than one million homes was wasted due to a lack of storage, according to a report by KPMG that was commissioned by the power company Drax.\n\nBut one firm, which won a 2022 Best of Innovation award at the CES technology show earlier this year, believes it has the solution.\n\nDutch startup, Ocean Grazer, has developed the Ocean Battery, which stores energy below the wind farm.\n\nWhen there is excess electricity the system pumps water from an underground reservoir into tough, flexible bladders that sit on the sea bed. You could think of them like big bicycle inner tubes. The water in those tubes is under pressure, so when it is released the water flows quickly and is directed through turbines, also on the sea bed, generating electricity when needed.\n\n\"The Ocean Battery, is effectively based on the same technology as hydro storage, where water is pumped back through a dam in a river, though we have transformed it into something you can deploy on the sea bed,\" says chief executive Frits Bliek.\n\nA protoype designed for deep water has already been tested at the port of Groningen in the Netherlands. The firm is now preparing to test a second system that has been modified for shallower water in a lake in the northern Netherlands. This should be operational next year.\n\nMany on-shore wind farms already use batteries to store extra power but there are a number of problems when it comes to using these offshore.\n\n\"If you want to build a large-scale system offshore, you would also need to build a really huge platform built of sea containers and that's been found to be very, very costly. Also the lifetime of the batteries is not very long,\" says Mr Bliek."

Frequently, they say, they have found themselves at odds with skating's norms and expectations during the course of their careers.\n\"For a long time, Timothy and I didn't see ourselves represented, and so we didn't quite feel like we belonged,\" Cain-Gribble tells CNN Sport.\n\"And for a long time, people had things to say about us. Even when we teamed up, they had a lot of things to say about my body, or about Timothy's sexuality. People still will make those comments.\"\nCain-Gribble, who at five-foot-six is taller than most women who compete in pairs skating, has previously spoken about how body shaming almost forced her to retire from the sport.\nShe adds: \"I think for us, it's about leading with authenticity, being our true selves out there and creating a very inclusive environment.\"\nCultivating that environment has meant doing things their own way, including when it comes to their costumes. The pair wear similar colors and patterns, while Cain-Gribble often competes in a long-sleeved unitard, rather than a dress."
